To run the project : 

go to chatbot/chatbot and hit npm i then run npm start and the application should run on localhost:3000

Sometimes the msw starts acting wild and shows an error(Cannot find the 'url') - if this happens please refresh until acts normal again 

The no data component is visible for a second until the query finishes,but to see it more,go to src/mocks/handles and change the route in the handles
